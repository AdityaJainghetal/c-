//In c++ , to solve real world problem we have 2 user defined data-type

//class->
	//	class is user defined data-type which is created to solve real world problem.
	//	class is a blueprint .here we actually define our data member and member function.
		//(it is merely a logical entity) 



//real world problem..> (tangible,non-tanggible)
//IRCTC -- > Ticket,food,passenger,money

//1.structure
//2.class
//			here we define attribute (data) and behavior(method)
//			but we want to secure our data, so in c++ we generally used class,
//			because in structure.
//			we don't have access specifier,(it is a concept of object oriented)

//clas variabel-----> objects
//===================================
//real world entity -------> objects

//objects are the real world entity
//objects are the instance of a class
//objects is also know as class variable




//note- structure member + function --> public(by default)
//         class member + function ----> private(by default)



//features of OOPS---->
//		1.Class and objects
//		2.Inheritance (in herit) (DRY)
//		3. Encapsulation (data-hidding)
//		4. Polymorphism (viva/interview) (function use--different way)
//		5. Abstraction (hidding application) (abstraction clas)
